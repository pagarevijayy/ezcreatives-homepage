#### Limitations (v1)

- [ ] strict image dimensions (crop before feeding)
- [ ] cover for the image scaling hack
- [ ] we create template for the user

#### Backlog

- [ ] Optimization (good to have but are not a blocker)

  - [ ] Image: accept any dimension of image without breaking design
  - [ ] UX: play loading and animation while images are getting ready
  - [ ] UX: safe checking - make sure ui doesn't break e.g the content or image is too large (limit: 200ch?)
  - [ ] UX: export individual image
  - [ ] Design: make existing design more customizable
  - [ ] Documentation: establish rules like string doesn't by default include `""`
  - [ ] UX: for multiple files zip and download!!! lol (like pwa icon generator)

- [ ] Issues (blocker)

  - [ ] mobile screen resolutions (dynamic resolution support?)
  - [ ] negative case scenarios
  - [ ] preview image option before download.
  - [ ] unreliable conversion: sometimes the image gets padded or cropped, sometimes works

- [ ] Functionality (roadmap)
  - [ ] export multiple formats (png, svg, etc)
  - [ ] accept multiple image dimensions (as per use case like cover image, thumbnail, etc.)
  - [ ] smart crop on images
  - [ ] QR codes
  - [ ] integrations: google sheets , zapier, airtable, forms
  - [ ] integrate with scheduler
  - [ ] create a 'copy to clip board' button (quote, caption, name, hashtag)
