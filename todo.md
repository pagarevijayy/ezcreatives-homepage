#### Backlog

- [ ] Optimization (good to have but are not a blocker)

  - [ ] Image: accept any dimension of image without breaking design
  - [ ] UX: play loading and animation while images are getting ready
  - [ ] UX: safe checking - make sure ui doesn't break e.g the content or image is too large (limit: 200ch?)
  - [ ] UX: export individual image
  - [ ] Design: make existing design more customizable
  - [ ] Documentation: establish rules like string doesn't by default include `""`
  - [ ] UX: for multiple files zip and download!!! lol (like pwa icon generator)
  - [ ] customize templates via ui (forms and drop-downs)
  - [ ] provide one design at a time ui ux

- [ ] Issues (blocker)

  - [ ] mobile screen resolutions (dynamic resolution support?)

  - [ ] export multiple formats (png, svg, etc)
  - [ ] image dimension: vertical (IG TV thumbnail and stories)
  - [ ] smart crop on images
